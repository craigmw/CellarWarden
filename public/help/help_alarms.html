<body><h2>Alarms</h2>

    <p>CellarWarden provides a means for
monitoring its operations and can be set up to send alarm notifications
if a specified sensor is outside of its normal working range. These
alarm notifications are sent to specified email addresses and can
trigger SMS/text messages to be sent via a cell phone.</p><br><p>Alarm Notification</p><p>If an alarm is triggered while the CellarWarden client app is open, a notification will pop up...</p><p><img style="width: 391px; height: 190px;" alt="Alarm Warning" src="AlarmWarning.JPG"></p><p>This will also be apparent in the LCD display on the last row...</p><p><img style="width: 371px; height: 132px;" alt="Alarm LCD display" src="AlarmLCD.JPG"></p><p>If
one or more email addresses are set up in the Alarms Dialog, email
messages and/or SMS/text messages will be sent to indicate the alarm
condition.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the sensor that triggered the alarm will be indicated on the graph in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sensors</span> tab when the mouse pointer hovers over the annotation box (labeled "2" in the example below)...</p><p><img style="width: 461px; height: 171px;" alt="Alarm Annotation" src="AlarmAnnotation.JPG"></p><h2>Alarms Configuration dialog</h2><p>The Alarms configuration may be set up by clicking the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarms</span> button on CellarWarden's banner.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span></p><p>This tab encompasses general features of the Alarms function...</p><p><img style="width: 905px; height: 575px;" alt="Alarms General" src="AlarmGeneral.JPG"></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarms Control</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activate Alarms:</span> Select this control as True when monitoring is desired.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">AutoClear Alarms:</span>
Select this control as True when it is desired to automatically clear
triggered alarms so that the alarm is not retriggered when the alarm
condition has not been rectified. When true, the Activate Alarms
control will be set to false to prevent additional alarm notifications.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Block Mult. Emails</span> Select this control as True to prevent the sending of multiple email and/or text/SMS messages.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Clear Active Alarms:</span>
Click this button after an alarm has been triggered. This will turn off
the client notification and return the LCD display operation to normal.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Alarm History:</span> Click this button to show a list of previously triggered alarms.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Clear Alarm History:</span>
Click this button to delete previously triggered alarms from the Alarm
History. This will also remove any alarms annotations from the sensors
graph.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarm Email/SMS Notificatons</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">From Email Service: </span>Name of the service provider for an email account that serves as the sender.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sender: </span>Address of
an email account that serves as the sender. It is suggested that a new
account devoted to CellarWarden be set up using a free email service
such as Gmail or Yahoo.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sender PW: </span>Password for the sender email account.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To Email1/Email2: </span>Addresses
for email accounts that serve as receivers of alarms notifications.
Each field can receive more than one email address by separating the
different email addresses with commas. To send SMS/text messages, use
your email provider's email address that will result in the
transmission of an SMS/text message. For example, to send to a Verizon
phone, use the format 1234567890@vtext.com, where the numbers in front
represent the area code and phone number of that account. More
information about sending SMS/text messages by email are provided <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-send-free-text-messages-online/">here</a>.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Send Test Email: </span>Click
this button to send a test email notification to each email address
listed in the above two fields. It is imporant to verify that alarm
notifications will be sent properly.</p><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Temperature</span><br><br><p>This tab is used to configure alarm conditions for temperature probes...</p><p><img style="width: 904px; height: 569px;" alt="Alarm Temp" src="AlarmTemp.JPG"> </p><p>Currently,
two temperature probes may be monitored although future versions will
include the ability to monitor additional temperature sensors.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Monitoring:</span> Click on True to monitor this sensor.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sen. 1/Sen. 2:</span> Select the temperature sensor from one of the two DHT-type sensors, or one of two 1-wire sensors (onew1, "OW1"; onew2, "OW2").<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Temp Maximum/Temp Minimum:</span>
Use these controls to enter a temperature range between minimum and
maximum values for this sensor. If the sensor returns a value outside
of this range, an alarm event will be triggered and the user notified.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarm Delay:</span>
An alarm will trigger after the alarm condition has been met for this
delay. This prevents an alarm from being triggered spuriously, e.g. by a
temporary increase in temperature due to opening a door.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Label:</span> Provide a short name for this sensor to use in alarm notifications.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Humidity</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img style="width: 903px; height: 571px;" alt="Alarm Humd" src="AlarmHumd.JPG"></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Monitoring:</span> Click on True to monitor this sensor.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sensor 1/Sensor2:</span> Select from DHT1 or DHT2.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Humidity Minimum/Maximum: </span>Set a range for humidity for this condition.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarm Delay:</span> As above.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Label:</span> Provide a short name for this sensor to use in alarm notifications.</p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Doors</span></p><p><img style="width: 905px; height: 569px;" alt="Alarm Doors" src="AlarmDoors.JPG"></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Monitoring:</span> Click on True to monitor this door sensor.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarm Delay:</span> If the door is left open for a period longer than this value, an alarm will be triggered.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Label:</span> Provide a short name for this door sensor to use in alarm notifications.</p><p style="font-weight: bold;">Power and Status</p><p>These tabs are currently non-functional but will be added in future updates of CellarWarden.</p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span></p><p>Click this button to save all changes in the Alarms dialog.</p><p></p><p style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel</p><p>Click this button to cancel any changes and close the Alarms dialog.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
