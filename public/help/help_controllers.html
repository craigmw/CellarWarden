<h2><a id="user-content-controllers" class="anchor" href="#controllers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Controllers</h2>
<p>CellarWarden supports control of wine cellars, fermentors and other
appliances through the provision of an unlimited number of controllers.
Each controller takes input from one or two thermal (e.g. DS18B20) or
humidity (e.g. DHT22) sensors and controls actuators connected via GPIO
outputs. Controller output may be one- or two-sided (e.g. heat only, or
heating and cooling with automatic switchover), and will attempt to
maintain a stable output to control temperature or humidity to a
defined setpoint. Controllers can also employ a setpoint profile in
which the setpoint varies over time, and these profiles can be created
on the fly or loaded from template files stored on the server.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2>Input(s)</h2><p>Controllers
may be configured to use one primary sensor, and an optional secondary
sensor, to monitor the output of an actuator/appliance (e.g.
refrigerator, heater, humidifier, etc). Sensors currently supported are
DS18B20 1-Wire temperature sensors and DHT11/DHT22-type
temperature/humidity sensors. CellarWarden provides upto 2 DHT-type and
8 DS18B20 sensors. If two sensors are used, the relative impact of the
secondary sensor on the input value will be factored using a percentage applied to the secondary value. For example, if sensor 1
reads 100F and sensor 2 reads 80F, a 50% "Sensor 2 priority" value will
give an input of 90F; this is a simple example of averaging between the two sensors. However,
it may be desirable to lower or increase the priority of sensor 2
accordingly.&nbsp;</p><br><h2>Output(s)</h2><p>Each controller supports
upto two actuators/appliances. These actuators are connected via GPIO
pins, and the controller will vary the output of these actuators based
on comparing the current input(s) to the desired setpoint in Automatic
mode. There are two options for Automatic output mode: Hysteresis and
PID. A third output mode is Manual mode, in which the setpoint is set
from 0 to 100% to manually control the output irrespective of the input
value.</p><br><p><a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis#Control_systems"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hysteresis mode</span></a>
attempts to maintain the current input value close to the setpoint and
will activate the actuator if it is above (or below) the setpoint. For
example, if the setpoint is 65F and the input value is 63F, the heating
actuator (if configured) will be activated until the input nears the
setpoint. Note that in Hysteresis mode, cooling/dehumidifying and
heating/humidifying Hysteresis values may be set to turn off actuator
output as it nears the setpoint. This will help to minimize over- or
under-shooting the setpoint, and will also limit rapid cycling of the
actuator(s).</p><img style="width: 800px; height: 412px;" alt="Hysteresis" src="Hysteresis.jpg"><p>Above,
we can see the output from a controller set to maintain temperature at
105F using Hysteresis mode, with hysteresis values of one degree F on
either side of the setpoint.&nbsp; </p><p><br><a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PID mode</span></a> attempts to maintain the current input value near the setpoint by using <span style="color: white;">PID control</span>.
It calculates the error between the input (process variable) and the
setpoint and automatically varies the output proportionally to maintain
the input near the setpoint. PID control is preferred when the actuator
will support this form of output. Currently, CellarWarden supports
software <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation#Time_proportioning">time-proportioning</a> output for PID control, but future versions will also support hardware <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">pulse-width-modulation (PWM)</a>
for compatible actuators (e.g. DC fans, valves, etc). For
time-proportioning, the output value is converted to a proportional
amount of time the actuator is on for a set period of time called the
"window." The amount of time for this window is set using the parameter
"PID Window Size." For example, for a window of 60 seconds, a 10%
output would cause the actuator to be on for 6 seconds and then off for
the remaining 54 seconds, and then the process would be repeated. Short
window sizes (&gt;= 2 seconds) are preferred for fast acting actuators
(e.g. heaters), whereas long window sizes (e.g. 300 seconds) are to be
used for slow acting actuators that might be damaged by rapid on/off
cycling (e.g. refrigerators).</p><img style="width: 800px; height: 392px;" alt="PID output" src="PID_Output.jpg"><p>Above
is an example of a controller using PID output mode. Here, the
temperature remains fairly stable, with the exception of some
disturbances toward the end of this sequence (cold water added at
around 18:05). The red line shows that the heating actuator was active
at 100% initially after the setpoint (green line) was shifted. After
reaching the setpoint, the heating actuator output stabilized at
roughly 80% to maintain the temperature. </p><p><a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="help_profile.html">Profile Mode</a>:
The setpoint for a controller can follow a time vs. setpoint profile in
either PID or Hysteresis output mode. This can be useful for control of
beer or wine fermentation, or to slowly ramp between different
temperature or humidity levels.</p><p><img style="width: 1007px; height: 519px;" alt="Profile Output" src="ProfileOutput.jpg"> </p><p>In&nbsp;the
example above, the controller is using PID output mode, with the
setpoint (green line) following a temperature profile. After ramping up
to the setpoint, the heating actuator stabilized at roughly 40% output,
and ramped up again before the profile called for cooling. Very complex
temperature or humidity profiles can be achieved through the use of
this function.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><h2>Controller configuration</h2><p>To
configure controllers, click on the Controllers button on the
&nbsp;CellarWarden banner. This will bring up the Controllers dialog:</p><img style="width: 904px; height: 840px;" alt="Controller dialog, part 1." src="ctrlDialog1.JPG"><br><br><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Controller dialog Banner</span></p><p>On the banner, there are three controls, a pulldown menu to select a controller to edit, an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span> button to add new controllers and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span> button to delete the currently selected controller. Additions and deletions will not be made until the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span> button is pressed.</p><br><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span></p><p>Here, general features of the selected controller may be edited.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Name&nbsp;</span>is used to provide a descriptive name for the controller. The&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Active</span>
checkbox is used to control the processing status of the controller.
Use this checkbox to turn the controller on and off. The&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setpoint</span>
box is used to set the desired temperature or humidity for this
controller (when a profile is not running on this controller). In
Manual output mode, this input is used to set the ouput (0-100%).&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Output Mode</span>
is used to select between automatic and manual output modes. Use Auto
for Hysteresis or PID controlled output. Use Manual Cool or Manual Heat
to apply a percent output (0-100%) to either actuator. Note that the
selected actuator must be in PID mode for manual output to function. In
Hysteresis mode, Manual output does not function.</p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Logging</span></p><p>A
controller's input and output values may be optionally saved to a log
file for viewing on the Main page under the "Controller" tab. For this,
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Log Data</span> checkbox must be checked, and a unique <span style="font-weight: bold;">Logfile</span> name provided.
The logfile should be named with the extension .csv, e.g. temp1.csv.
These logfiles are comma delimited text files and may be downloaded
from the server in the ../CellarW/public/controllers directory and
viewed using Excel or other spreadsheet software.

If a secondary sensor is desired, enter the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sensor 2 Priority</span> (from 0 to 100%) and select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sensor2 Name</span> from the pulldown list.&nbsp;</p><p>Use the scroll bar on the right to see the rest of the Controllers configuration dialog...</p><p><img style="width: 903px; height: 843px;" alt="Controller Dialog part 2" src="ctrlDialog2.JPG"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cooling/Dehumidifying</span></p><p>This
fieldset describes the cooling or dehumidifying actuator that will be
controlled. Enter the GPIO number that connects to the actuator. Note
that the Broadcom (BCM) GPIO number is used, not the actual pin on the
GPIO header of the Raspberry Pi. More information about GPIO pin
numbering can be found by clicking on <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="http://pinout.xyz/">this link</a>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test GPIO Pin</span> button to test the functionality of this GPIO pin; a two second pulse will be sent to activate this pin. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Invert Output</span>
checkbox may be selected to invert the output of this GPIO, a feature
useful for connecting to relay boards that require the GPIO to be
pulled low to be turned on. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use PWM</span> checkbox is currently inactive, but will provide hardware PWM output in a future update of CellarWarden.</p><p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delay</span> parameter can be set to a non-zero value (in minutes) to cause a delay in switching on the actuator after it has turned off.
For example, if the delay is set to 5, after switching off, the cooling
actuator will be delayed for 5 minutes before it can switch on again.
The purpose of this delay is to prevent rapid cycling of the actuator
which could damage certain appliances, e.g. those with compressors like
refrigerators, wine cellar cooling units, etc. This delay is
implemented in both Hysteresis and PID output modes. Use a long delay
time (e.g. 5 minutes) for compressor-based appliances, and a short or
no delay for fast-acting appliances (e.g. heaters, ultrasonic misters).
When the actuator has a delay, the output on the Controller tab graph
will be discontinuous, reflecting times when the actuator is on vs.
when it is in a delay. An example of this is shown for a heating
actuator in PID mode with a set delay of 2 minutes...</p><p><img style="width: 687px; height: 398px;" alt="Controller delay" src="ControllerDelay.JPG"></p><p>Note the broken red lines shortly after the input (black line) surpasses the setpoint (green line). Since
PID mode uses <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation#Time_proportioning">time-proportioning</a> (e.g. the actuator turns on for a
percentage of the time window and then turns off), each time it turns
off, the actuator will enter the delay mode and the LCD display will
indicate "Waiting for Heat," etc. Since the actuator is off during these
delay periods, the red line showing heating output is broken. Note that
the roll window is set to 1. If the roll window is higher than one,
averaging may connect the segments in which the heating actuator was
on, again an artifact of applying a rolling average to such data.</p><p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Control Mode</span> may be set for Hysteresis or PID mode by clicking on the correct radio button. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hysteresis </span>sets
a value for cooling/dehumidifying in which the actuator will turn off
before the input hits the setpoint. For cooling, the Hysteresis value
will be added to the setpoint. For example, with Hysteresis set to 2,
if the setpoint is 65F, the actuator will turn off when the input
reaches 67F. The&nbsp;Hysteresis value does not currently impact PID control and only affects Hysteresis mode.</p><p>Use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PID Autotune</span>
button to activate autotuning on this actuator.&nbsp;Note that autotuning is
supported for both the Cooling/Dehumidifying and Heating/Humidifying
actuators independently. Only one actuator may be autotuned at a time.
To independently autotune the cooling/dehumidifying actuator, turn off
the heating/humidifying actuator
by unplugging it or by entering a blank value in the heating actuator's
GPIO Pin field. It is suggested that you autotune your system at a
stable temperature where the output is greater than 20% and less than
80% to obtain the most reliable tuning parameters. You may also
manually set the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID values</a> for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kp</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ki</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kd</span> by entering these values in each field. Note that autotuning may yield very large values for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kd</span>
parameter, reflecting the relatively slow processes controlled by this
actuator. More reasonable values less than 20 give more stable outputs.
Autotuning may take some time (an hour or more) for slow processes, and
the autotune mode will be indicated by an "AC" or "AH" prefix on the
status line of the LCD panel. Autotuning will also be apparent on this
actuator as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PID Autotune</span> button will toggle to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel Autotuning</span>.
Click this button to cancel autotuning. If the autotune routine has
been long enough (at least one cycle), preliminary tuning parameters
will be reported in the server log. If the autotune routine is allowed
to complete, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kp</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ki</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kd</span> fields will be filled with the calculated values.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img style="width: 800px; height: 548px;" alt="Autotuning" src="AutotuneDelay.JPG"></p><p>Autotuning
is engaged on the heating actuator above. Note the discontinuous lines
(red dots), indicating that the heating actuator has a delay set to
minimize rapid cycling on this actuator. For this example, the
temperature (input) was allowed to rise and settle near the setpoint
and then the autotune routine was started. This results in a shift in
the actuator output roughly 20% higher than when started, resulting in
a peak in the temperature. Then the output shifts to 20% below the
starting output level, resulting in a lower peak. This process is
repeated until the autotune routine has determined the average cycle
time, allowing for calculation of the PID tuning parameters. CellarWarden employs the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziegler%E2%80%93Nichols_method">Ziegler-Nichols PID autotuning algorithm</a>,
which yields fairly aggressive tuning parameters. It is useful for
reaching the setpoint quickly and for minimizing cycling, but it tends to
result in an overshoot on the first cycle. To minimize this overshoot,
you may wish to reduce the Kp value somewhat. More information about
PID autotuning is available <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2012/01/arduino-pid-autotune-library/">here</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">PID Window Size</span> field is used to set the window length in seconds for time-proportioning control as explained above.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Heating/Humidifying</span></p><p>The
parameters in this fieldset are similar to those in the
Cooling/Dehumidifying fieldset, but control the heating or humidifying
actuator. Note that if the controller requires only a single actuator
(either Cooling/Dehumidifying or Heating/Humidifying), leave the GPIO
pin blank for the actuator that will not be connected to an appliance.
Even if an actuator is not connected, it is important that PID Kp, Ki
and Kd values are set for this actuator when in PID mode; just copy
these values from the active actuator's fieldset. For
heating/humidifying, the Hysteresis value will be subtracted from the
setpoint so that the actuator turns off before hitting the setpoint.
For example, if the setpoint is 65F and the Hysteresis value is 1, the
actuator will turn off when the input hits 64F.</p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Profile</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Each controller may use a single profile that will vary the setpoint over time.
