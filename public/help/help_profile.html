    <h2>Profiles</h2><p>CellarWarden supports the use of
controller profiles to control the setpoint of the controller over
time. These profiles are accessed in the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="help_controllers.html">Controllers</a> configuration dialog.
Profiles may be developed "from scratch" using the profile editor or
templates may be loaded from within the dialog. Note that loaded
profiles obey the Time Increment setting in the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="help_controllers.html">Controllers</a> configuration dialog.</p><br><h2>Editing the Profile</h2><p>Open the Profile Dialog from within the Controllers configuration dialog by clicking on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Profile </span>button...</p><p><img style="width: 630px; height: 919px;" alt="Profile dialog" src="Profiles.JPG" align="middle"></p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Profile Banner</span><p>The
top of this dialog presents information about the currently loaded
profile, including the controller it is associated with (in this case,
Temperature 1), the profile name (Testing PID functions), the activity
status (Profile Active: True), the current segment in the profile that
is active (Current Segment: 0) and the elapsed time in this segment
(Seg. Elapsed: 0.8 days). Note that clicking on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Profile </span>button in the Controllers dialog allows for editing or viewing a running profile.</p><p></p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Profile Graph</span><p>In
the center of the Profile Dialog, a graph depicting the profile over
time is presented. The Y-axis represents either the temperature or
humidity setpoint, depending on the mode selected in the Controller
Dialog. The X-axis represents time over the course of the profile.
Again, recall that time depicted here is set by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Time Increment</span> control in the Controllers Dialog.If
a profile is currently running/active, an orange marker will be
displayed that indicates the current segment and approximate duration
within that segment. This provides a quick method for checking the
status of an active profile.  </p><p></p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Profile Editor</span><p>Below
the graph, the Profile Editor is provided. The profile is split up into
different segments, starting from segment 0 to as many segments as are
needed. If a profile is running, the currently active segment will be
highlighted. To add a new segment to the end of the current profile,
click
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Segment</span> button. To
edit a segment, click on the edit control (this looks like a pencil at
the right of each segment row). This will open an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Segment</span>
dialog
in which the Duration, Start Setpoint, End Setpoint and Hold parameters
may be edited. For ramping, the start and end setpoints can be
different and CellarWarden will automatically ramp between these
temperatures over the duration of the segment. For a stepped segment,
set the Start and End setpoints to the same value. To delete a segment,
click on the delete button (this is an X at the right of each segment
row). Note that it is not possible to delete segments if the profile is
currently running.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><h2>Profile Templates</h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Load Templates</span><p>To load a pre-existing template, click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Load Template</span> button...</p><br><img style="width: 506px; height: 248px;" alt="Load Template" src="LoadTemplate.JPG"><p>Use
the pulldown menu to select a template to load. After selecting a
template, the Profile Name and number of segments will be shown. Click
on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Load</span> button to load this into the Profile Editor. Click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span> button to delete this template from the server. Press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel</span> to return to the Profile Editor dialog. Note that it is not possible to load a template if the profile is active.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving Templates</span><p>After editing a profile, this may be saved as a template on the server. To do so, click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save Template</span> button, which will bring up the following dialog:</p><img style="width: 381px; height: 206px;" alt="Save Template" src="SaveTemplate.JPG"><br><br><p>Provide a Filename with the extension .pro, e.g. Hellesbock.pro. This filename must correspond to Linux <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="http://linuxg.net/the-7-main-rules-for-naming-files-and-folders-in-linux-and-unix/">filename convensions</a>.
Enter a descriptive Profile Name of less than about 20 characters. Note
that profile templates are stored in the directory
../CellarW/public/profiles.</p><br></body></html>
