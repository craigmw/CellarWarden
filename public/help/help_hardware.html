<body><h2>Hardware Examples</h2>

    <p>CellarWarden supports many
different hardware configurations for temperature/humidity monitoring
and control for a variety of applications. Here are a few examples of
such hardware configurations.</p><h2>Minimal Setup</h2><img style="width: 800px; height: 712px;" alt="Minimal Configuration" src="CellarWardenMin_bb.jpg"><p>Here, a modest monitoring configuration is shown. A Raspberry Pi is connected via a <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2029">Pi Cobbler Plus</a>
to a breadboard. A single DS18B20 1-wire temperature probe is connected
to GPIO 4, with a 4.7k resistor tied to the 3.3 volt rail. A single
DHT22 temperature/humidity probe is connected via GPIO 5, also with a
4.7k resistor tied to 3.3V. A single door switch is connected to GPIO
21, and if the door is closed, this will pull the GPIO pin to 3.3V.
This configuration is useful for monitoring wine cellars, meat
lockers, cigar humidors, refrigerators, etc. </p><h2>Complex Monitoring Configuration</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/craigmw/CellarWarden/blob/master/CellarWarden_bb.jpg"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 800px; height: 600px;" alt="Complex Monitoring" src="CellarWarden_bb.jpg"></a><a href="https://github.com/craigmw/CellarWarden/blob/master/CellarWarden_bb.jpg" target="_blank"><br></a></p>

<p>Shown are two DHT22/AM2302 sensors connected on GPIO pins 5 and 6
(RPiB+), two DS18B20 1-wire sensors connected in series to GPIO pin 4, a 20 x 4 parallel LCD display based on the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_HD44780_LCD_controller">Hitachi HD44780 display driver</a> and a
door switch connected to GPIO pin 21 through a <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Toshiba/TLP621-4F/?qs=f0GatGUIxV25OfmkgyzvLw%3D%3D">TLP621 optocoupler</a>.
This
optocoupler is required to provide enough current to the LCD backlight,
while isolating the GPIO pin from the 5V used for this backlight.
Alternatively, a DPDT microswitch can be used for the door switch,
allowing 3.3V to be used to switch the GPIO pin high (3.3V) when the
door is closed while switching 5V to the LCD backlight when the door is
open. If no LCD is used, just run the common of a SPDT microswitch to
3.3V and the GPIO pin to the normally open terminal. As the RPi runs at
3.3V, it is imperative that 5V not be sent to the GPIO pins, as this
will surely destroy your RPi. While not required, an <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2029">Adafruit Pi
Cobbler Plus</a> simplifies wiring this up on a breadboard.</p>

<br><h2>Complex Controller Configuration</h2><img style="width: 800px; height: 675px;" alt="Complex Controller Configuration" src="CellarWardenIO_bb.jpg"><p>In
this example, CellarWarden is configured to control several actuators
and uses two (up to 8) DS18B20 1-wire temperature sensors, two DHT22
temp/humidity probes, a 20 x 4 LCD panel over the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">I2C bus</a>.
All inputs and outputs are buffered by I2C compatible bi-directional
logic level shifters (LLS). Three 4-channel bi-directional LLS boards
similar to <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009">these</a>
are used, with all input and output shifted from the RPi's 3.3V output
to 5V output. These LLS boards are useful, as they shield the RPi from
damaging high voltages. In addition, they provide sufficient voltage
and current for driving LCD panels and actuators without causing "brown
outs" of the RPi's 3.3V line. Also shown is a <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/264">realtime clock (RTC) board</a>
based on the DS1307 chip connected to the buffered I2C bus. This
provides a means to obtain the current time even if the RPi is not
connected to the internet (where it normally obtains the current date
and time). The <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="http://www.sainsmart.com/sainsmart-iic-i2c-twi-serial-2004-20x4-lcd-module-shield-for-arduino-uno-mega-r3.html">I2C-compatible 20 x 4 LCD display</a> in this case is also connected to the I2C bus via an I2C LCD display "backpack" based on the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="http://www.nxp.com/products/interface-and-connectivity/interface-and-system-management/i2c/i2c-general-purpose-i-o/remote-8-bit-i-o-expander-for-icbus-with-interrupt:PCF8574P">PCF8574 8-bit port expander chip</a>. In
this case, the LCD address on the I2C bus is 0x27 and the RTC board is
at 0x68. More information about setting up the I2C bus on an RPi can be
found <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c">here</a>.</p><p>This
configuration can be built using a breadboard and Pi Cobbler Plus as
shown, or can be built into a more permanent configuration using a <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2310">Perma Proto HAT board</a>...</p><p><img style="width: 800px; height: 448px;" alt="CW Pi HAT" src="PiHat.jpg">&nbsp;</p><p>This
shows an RPi 3 board with the Perma Proto HAT connected to an RTC board
and a 20 x 4 LCD display over the LLS buffered I2C bus. Note the
position of the bi-directional LLS boards, three of which are included.
These three boards provide a total of twelve 5V buffered inputs and outputs: 1-wire
bus, two DHT-type sensors, the I2C bus, and 7 additional I/O ports that
can be used for connecting to door switches or actuators. Since the
buffered outputs are at 5V, these can directly drive&nbsp; <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="http://www.sainsmart.com/4-channel-5v-relay-module-for-pic-arm-avr-dsp-arduino-msp430-ttl-logic.html">mechanical</a> and <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="http://www.sainsmart.com/sainsmart-4-channel-5v-solid-state-relay-module-board-omron-ssr-avr-dsp-arduino.html">solid state relay (SSR)</a> boards developed for the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>.
Despite its compact size, this configuration will support seven actuators
or door switches. If more buffered I/O is needed, additional LLS boards
may be employed, but this would not likely fit onto a Perma Proto HAT
board.</p><p><br></p>
