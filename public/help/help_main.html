    <h2>Main Window</h2><p>The main window in CellarWarden
presents information about the status of sensors and controllers that
have been set up and provides a means to configure the server that
operates in the background on the Raspberry Pi. The main window is
broken into two parts, the banner at the top and the graph window that
displays logged data.</p><img style="width: 1259px; height: 857px;" alt="Main Sensors" src="MainSensors.jpg"><br><br><h2>The Banner</h2><p>CellarWarden presents a banner at the top of the main window
showing buttons that allow configuration of CellarWarden, the title and
a virtual LCD display.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buttons</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Configure</span>: Opens the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="help_config.html">Configuration Dialog</a> to configure overall operations of CellarWarden.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Controllers</span>: Opens up the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="help_controllers.html">Controllers Dialog</a> to allow configuration of each controller.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alarms</span>: Click this to configure alarms using the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="help_alarms.html">Alarms Dialog</a>.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Help</span>: Click this to open the CellarWarden help pages.</p><br><h2>LCD Display</h2><p>A
virtual LCD display is shown at the right of the banner and provides
realtime updates of the status of CellarWarden. This displays the same
information as a hardware LCD display if one is connected to the
Raspberry Pi. If no controllers are
active, this display only shows a single page.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LCD Page 1:</span></p><img style="width: 365px; height: 131px;" alt="Main LCD1" src="MainLCD1.jpg"><p>This page shows the current date and time, the temperature and humidity values from DHT1 (a temperature/humidity sensor),
and the temperature detected on onew1, a DS81B20 1-wire temperature
probe. When CellarWarden is first started, this bottom row will show
the IP address of the server for one minute. If an Alarm has been
triggered, the bottom row will instead indicate that an Alarm has been
triggered until the Clear Active Alarms button is pressed (more
information about this is available in the <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="help_alarms.html">Alarms dialog</a>).&nbsp;</p><p></p><p style="font-weight: bold;">LCD Page 2, etc.:</p><p>If
one or more controllers are active, CellarWarden will display the
status of each active controller by toggling the page, showing each
controller in round-robbin fashion as well as LCD page 1...</p><img style="width: 375px; height: 139px;" alt="Main LCD 2" src="MainLCD2.jpg"><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Row 1</span>: Displayed here are the controller number (Ctrl 0) and the name of the controller (Fermentor 1).</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Row 2</span>: The input (process variable/PV) and the name of the primary sensor (onew1) are displayed.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Row 3</span>: The setpoint (SP) and output (OutP) are shown. <span style="font-weight: bold;">OutP</span> designates that this controller is using PID mode, whereas a controller using Hysteresis mode will display <span style="font-weight: bold;">OutH</span>.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Row 4</span>:
The status of the controller is shown here. &nbsp;In this case, the
controller is heating. This row may also display- Cooling, Humidifying,
Dehumidifying, Waiting to Heat, Waiting to Cool, Waiting to Humid.,
Waiting to Dehumid. The latter 4 status messages indicate that an
actuator on the controller has been set with a delay to prevent rapid
cycling and is waiting for the delay to elapse before engaging the
actuator. The status line will show the prefix "<span style="font-weight: bold;">AH</span>" or "<span style="font-weight: bold;">AC</span>" if the heating/humidifying or cooling/dehumidifying actuator is being autotuned, respectively.&nbsp; </p><p></p><p></p><h2>Graph Window - Sensors tab</h2><p>The graph section is tabbed, and allows viewing of the Sensors graph and the Controller graph. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sensors</span> tab opens the main graph window, and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Controller</span> tab shows logged data for a selected controller. </p><br style="font-weight: bold;"><img style="width: 1259px; height: 857px;" alt="Sensors tab" src="MainSensors.jpg"><br><p>Displayed
is a graph of all active sensors, including DHT-type temp/humidity
sensors, DS18B20 1-wire sensors and door switches. Also,
annotations&nbsp;marked by a small box enclosing a number next to a
specific plot line indicate an alarm has been triggered for that
sensor.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p style="font-weight: bold;">Legend</p><p>A
legend is shown at the top right of the window if the mouse pointer is
placed over the graph. This will display the date/time and various
sensor values for the selected time. Note that data will only be
plotted for active sensors. Door open/close events are shown near the
bottom of the plot. If the mouse pointer is moved off of the graph
window, the legend is hidden.&nbsp;</p><p></p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Roll Window</span><p>A small input box to the bottom left of the graph is the Roll Window...</p><p><img style="width: 261px; height: 270px;" alt="Roll Window" src="MainSensorsRoll.jpg"></p><p>This applies a <a style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average">rolling average</a>
to the displayed data, and defaults to 10, meaning that each displayed
data point is the rolling average over 10 samples. Set this to 1 to
show unaveraged results.&nbsp;</p><br><br><h2>Graph Window - Controller tab</h2><img style="width: 1269px; height: 869px;" alt="Main Controller" src="MainController.jpg"><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Controller Banner</span></p><p>The
Controller window shows logged data on a selected controller. The
banner at the top of this window allows a means to select a specific
controller using a dropdown menu...</p><p><img style="width: 1264px; height: 137px;" alt="Controller Banner" src="MainControllerBanner.jpg"></p><p>Filename: Shows the filename associated with the selected controller.</p><p>Sensor: Displays the primary sensor name for this controller.</p><p>Status: Shows if the controller is active or inactive.</p><p>Profile:
Displays the name of the Profile if it has been loaded for this
controller. Also shows if the profile is running or stopped (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stopped</span>).</p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Legend:</span></p><img style="width: 237px; height: 196px;" alt="Controller Legend" src="MainController_legend.jpg"><p>Shows
the time/date, the input (process variable), the setpoint and the
output value for the heating/humidifying or cooling/dehumifying
actuator on the selected controller.</p><p style="font-weight: bold;">The Roll Window:</p><p>As
with the Sensors window, the graph in the Controller window has a roll
window box. This defaults to 1 to show unaveraged values for the
controller. This may be set to &gt; 1 to apply a rolling average,
however note that this may make it appear that cooling and heating
actuators are active at the same time near crossover points (periods in
which the input/PV crosses the setpoint line). This is merely an
artifact of
averaging as the heating/humidifying and cooling/dehumidifying
actuators cannot be active simultaneously. </p><p></p></body></html>
